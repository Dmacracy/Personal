### Hello
Hey! I'm Daniel and this is a test personal website. I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley's School of Information. I'm interested in a lot of topics but especially those relating to data science, computer science, physics, geography, literature, music, politics, and nature.

### CV
Here's a somewhat recent [CV](cv.pdf) and my [linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-estevan-mcandrew/).
